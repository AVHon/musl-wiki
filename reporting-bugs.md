# Reporting Bugs

Bug reports should be sent to the musl mailing list,
`musl@lists.openwall.net`. You do not need to be subscribed to post to
the list, but posts from non-subscribers may experience short delays
pending moderation. If you want to subscribe, visit the [Openwall
lists page](http://www.openwall.com/lists/). If you are not subscribed
and want to be Cc'd on replies, please mention that in your post.

Please include in your bug report information about how you're using
musl (as part of a musl-based distro, with the `musl-gcc` wrapper,
using a cross toolchain, etc.) and any information that could be
helpful in identifying or reproducing the bug.
