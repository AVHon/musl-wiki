# Funding Maintenance and Development

musl has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/musl) to fund maintenance
and development by the main project author, Rich Felker.

Other code contribitors have also performed porting and implementation
of new functionality by contract. If there is functionality you need
and want to fund that is or might be in the scope of the project, or
that could be met with a side project (for an example, see
[musl-nscd](https://github.com/pikhq/musl-nscd)), please get in touch.
